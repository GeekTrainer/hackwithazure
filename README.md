Every hacker needs a toolkit. Here's the three main tools you'll need:

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is the most popular code editor. Lightweight and flexible, Code can be used with almost any programming language and project type, from [Python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) to [C#](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/dotnet), [web dev](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript) to [data science and machine learning](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/overview). There's also a [full suite of extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) available to further enhance your development.

### Azure for Students

Microsoft Azure offers a host of cloud-based services and functionality. You can add [artificial intelligence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/what-are-cognitive-services?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) to your projects or build your own [machine learning solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-machine-learning-studio?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa). You can [host websites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) and create [IoT projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-fundamentals/iot-introduction?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa).

If you are a college student, you can sign up for $100 in free credit with [Azure for Students](https://aka.ms/a4s)!

### Microsoft Learn

A hackathon is a great time to learn new frameworks and skills. Maybe it's a new framework like [React](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/react?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) or [Django](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/django-create-data-driven-websites?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa), or a language like [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/csharp-first-steps?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa), [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/python-first-steps?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) or [TypeScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa). [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) has a full collection of courses available to you to help you improve your skills.
