# Hacking with Microsoft Azure

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) is a flexible, scalable, and full-featured cloud platform. If you can imagine it, you can build it on Azure, using the tools, languages and frameworks you're already familiar with. Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET - you can run them all on Azure.

Using Azure you can run serverless code using [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa), [host web applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) and [databases](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/databases/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa), take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) through [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa), and create your own machine learning models through [Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-designer?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa).

## Activate your Azure account

There's three different options available to create an account on Azure, depending on your current status as a student.

- [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) | $100 in Azure for 12 months with free tier of services - no credit card required with academic verification
- [Azure for Students Starter](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students-starter-faq/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) | use select Azure products like App Services for free - no credit card required with academic verification

## Getting started

- [Hack based workshops](./workshops.md): Designed for the team who likes to self-explore, we have created a series of hack-based workshops to help you explore Azure. Each workshop will present a series of goals to accomplish, and help you gain experience using Azure for hackathons.
- [Learning paths for students](https://aka.ms/StudentsLearn): Hands-on learning paths and modules designed for students. Learn about the cloud, AI, and even how to code for free with these short, hands-on modules.

## Take it to the next level

- [Imagine Cup](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=hackwithazure-hackathon-cxa) is a global competition for the next generation of students. Team up, and use your creativity, passion, and knowledge of technology to create applications that shape how we live, work, and play. Every year, tens of thousands of students from across the globe compete for cash, travel, and prizes and for the honor of taking home the Imagine Cup!
- [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com) is a community of university students around the world with an interest in technology. Coding is our shared common language. You might find yourself leading your own hackathon, mentoring computer science students, or unlocking the next great idea with your team – it’s all up to you. The program is all about gaining leadership experiences and getting access to resources and develop your technical and career skills. And we have a lot of fun too.
