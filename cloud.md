## Microsoft Azure

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa) is a flexible, scalable, and full-featured cloud platform. If you can imagine it, you can build it on Azure, using the tools, languages and frameworks you're already familiar with. Python, JavaScript, Java, .NET - you can run them all on Azure.

Using Azure you can run serverless code using [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa), [host web applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa) and [databases](https://azure.microsoft.com/product-categories/databases/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa), take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) through [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa), and create your own machine learning models through [Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-designer?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-cxa).

### Activate your Azure account
